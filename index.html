			<p>The Peles castle was built by the first King of Romania, Carol I of Hohenzollern – Sigmaringen, between 1873 and 1914. By 1883, the year of its inauguration, it was used as summer residence. Between 1890 and 1914, under the supervision of the Czech architect Karel Liman, considered the main architect, the castle was transformed and enlarged. Decoration: in the first shape (1883), both exterior and interior stylistic dominant is provided by the German neo-Renaissance style with two exceptions, the neo-Ottoman and the neo-Rococo styles. In the second stage (1890-1914), fundamental changes to the volumes, façades and interiors enriched the previous stylistic range, adapting the castle to the stylistic pluralism of Historicism.</p>
			<p>The Pelisor castle is part of the vast architectural ensemble created by King Carol I, along the Peles river’s valley, during the entire period of his reign. It was built between 1899 and 1902, as a residence for the Royal Heirs to the throne of Romania, Prince Ferdinand and Princess Marie. As opposed to the solemnity of the Great Castle, the Pelisor Castle, although on the exterior one can easily recognize the German Neo- Renaissance style, is decorated in a new, modern style.</p>

			<p>Siriu is a commune in Buzău County, Muntenia, Romania, on the valley of Buzău River. It is composed of five villages: Cașoca, Colțu Pietrii, Gura Siriului, Lunca Jariștei (the commune centre) and Mușcelușa.</p>
			<p>Siriu is located in the north-western part of the county, in the Buzău Mountains, at the Carpathians' curvature, on both sides of the Buzău River. The maximum altitude of the Siriu commune exceeds 1400 m.</p>
			<p>The Siriu Dam, constructed between 1982 and 1994 and its artificial lake are located in the commune. Lacul Vulturilor is a periglacial lake also located in Siriu.</p>
			<p>In 1972, 10 chamois were brought to Siriu and released in the wilderness of the mountain ranges. As of 2007, their number has risen to around 60. One of the largest firs in Romania, measuring 62 meters in height and 2.5 meters in diameter, grows in a forest in Siriu.[2] A protected plant, Drosera rotundifolia, can also be found in the Siriu forests.</p>
			<p>The oldest attestation of Siriu dates back to the mid-sixteenth century. A document issued by the voivod of Wallachia granted ownership of some land in Siriu to Petru and Lupu.</p>

			<p>Emerald Lake from Racos, a name derived from the color of the water, is said to have a depth of 10 meters. Emerald Lake was formed by melting snow and precipitation. Nearby is the extinct volcano, in an area with poorer, reddish vegetation. In the past, volcanic slag was mined in these places. Even if there is no water, the fauna continues to exist and to withstand the environment. Geologists say that the place is similar to that of Mount Etna, where the same types of rocks and colors are found. Specialists have discovered here types of slag, such as ash, volcanic bombs, pumice, basalt, hardened lava, and more.</p>
